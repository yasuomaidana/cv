    <p>
      I'm an engineer that loves programming, electronics, robotics, research,
      3D printing ... and breaking things.
      <br />
      In a few words, I enjoy learning new stuff. I would like to think about
      myself as a scientist, or at least I'm pursuing the spirit.
      <br />
      I believe that through science and compassion, we can enhance our world.
      <br />
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Science to understand how our world works, the reason why things are the
        way they are, and how to control/enhance them.
      </li>
      <li> And compassion to integrate ourselves and others into society.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I enjoy programming too much that I worked professionally in that industry
      for a while. My first contact with programming was through simulations,
      and since then it has become one of my favorite hobbies.
      <br />I also love machine learning-related topics, I found very
      interesting the analysis of our way of thinking and how to replicate it.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm always looking for opportunities/exciting projects where I can learn
      new things and mix my current knowledge.
